      <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The dotSkapes Virtual Lab (dS) is a global ecohealth research platform for rapidly identifying relevant scientific resources and empowering collaborative analysis in a geo-visualization environment. The main components of dS are the depot, lab, map client, and dashboards. The resource depot hosts geospatial resources and analytical tools connected to a custom search engine trained on scientific abstracts and collective intelligence. The virtual lab allows users to fuse maps, data, algorithms, and visualization components for private research or collaboration with colleagues and the public. The map client combines a high-performance visualization engine and and geospatial analysis system. Lastly, the dashboards combine preconfigured visualization components and analytical tools to explore complex data sets for real-time biosurveillance, research, or teaching. The dS scientific documentation system combines features of a wiki, content management system, and blog for scientific reporting, tutorials, and case studies.</p>

      <h2>Development status</h2>
<p><b>Version 0.5</b> was released in June 2012 as an intermediary between our alpha and beta releases. We are currently redesigning the user experience in the labs and depot. This release replaces the find, analyze, share, and tag structure with the lab, depot, dash, and map client. The beta release is anticipated for fall 2012</p> 


      <p><b>Version 0.4</b> was released in June 2011 to showcase web approaches to global health research. This website and alpha application are under active development. Through open and public development practices (e.g. GitHub) we hope to to encourage the global environmental health and open source communities to join us in the development of a new analytical cyberinfrasture.

      <h2>Opening a web of knowledge discovery</h2>
      
      <p>Global public health in the 21st century will require careful attention to processes of global environmental change. These challenges necessitate open, interdisciplinary access to cross-cutting tools and data. The flow of information is currently limited by a lack of tools to integrate datasets, maps, and local knowledge. Advances in computing hold the promise of a new cyberinfrastructure for studying global environmental change and human health. dotSkapes leverages these advances to address: difficulties finding relevant information, limited access to analytical tools, and poor knowledge transfer across a fractured social network.</p>
